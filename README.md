I'm currently a junior at Harvard College studying Computer Science and Math. 

I have interests in theoretical machine learning, computer systems, and cultural anthropology. Previously, I've published a [new method](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-34626-6) to find differential signals in high-dimensional genomics data, created a state-of-the-art [membership inference attack](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-34626-6) (privacy attack) on LLMs, built a [marketplace](https://quidio.co) for technical freelancing jobs (React/Express/Firebase), and contributed to a Harvard [course search tool](https://classes.wtf) that is 100x faster than MyHarvard (Go/Redis/Svelte). 

My GitHub is a scattering of public projects as well as many private repositories. In my spare time, I write poetry and creative nonfiction, blog on Quora/Medium to 6+ million people, and create knowledge graphs on Obsidian.
