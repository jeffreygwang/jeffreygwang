# Hello!

I'm currently a junior at Harvard College studying Computer Science and Math. I have interests in theoretical machine learning, computer systems, high-dimensional statistics, and the anthropology of Americana. 

Previously, I've published a [new method](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-34626-6) to identify differential signals in high-dimensional genomics data, created state-of-the-art privacy and data extraction attacks on LLMs (extracting 50%+ of a fine-tuned LLM's train set!), open-sourced a red-teaming [library](https://github.com/safr-ai-lab/pandora-llm), built a [marketplace](https://quidio.co) for technical freelancing jobs (React/Express/Firebase), and contributed to a Harvard [course search tool](https://classes.wtf) that is 100x faster than MyHarvard (Go/Redis/Svelte). 

My GitHub is a scattering of public projects as well as many private repositories. See my [website](https://jeffreygwang.com) for more!
